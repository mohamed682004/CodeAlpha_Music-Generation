# AI-Powered Music Generation 🎵

This project demonstrates the use of **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks to generate original music sequences. The goal is to explore deep learning techniques for music composition and understand the fundamentals of sequence modeling.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The system uses a dataset of MIDI files to train an LSTM-based model. The model learns patterns in the music sequences and generates new music based on the learned patterns. The project is implemented using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.

### Key Features:
- **Dataset**: MIDI files from the [MAESTRO dataset](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/maestro).
- **Model**: LSTM-based neural network for sequence generation.
- **Output**: Generated music in MIDI format.

## 🛠️ Installation

 **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CodeAlpha_Music-Generation/music-generation.git
   cd music-generation
   ```

## 🎹 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - MIDI files are parsed into sequences of notes and chords.
   - The sequences are converted into numerical representations for training.

2. **Model Training**:
   - An LSTM-based model is trained on the sequences to predict the next note or chord.
   - The model is trained for a specified number of epochs.

3. **Music Generation**:
   - The trained model generates new music sequences based on a seed input.
   - The generated sequences are converted back into MIDI format for playback.

## ⏱️ Performance

- **Training Time**: ~32 minutes (on a standard CPU).
- **Model Accuracy**: The model achieves reasonable accuracy in predicting the next note or chord in a sequence.

## 🚨 Challenges

- **Training Time**: Training deep learning models on a local machine can be time-consuming.
- **Hardware Limitations**: Without a GPU, training large models can be inefficient.

## 💡 Alternative Approaches

For faster results and better performance, consider using the following alternatives:

### 1. **Google Colab** 🖥️
   - Google Colab provides free access to GPUs and TPUs, significantly reducing training time.
   - You can upload your dataset and code to Colab and leverage its powerful hardware.

### 2. **Hugging Face Models** 🤗
   - Hugging Face offers pre-trained models for music generation, such as [MuseNet](https://huggingface.co/models?search=music) and [Jukebox](https://huggingface.co/models?search=jukebox).
   - These models are ready to use and can generate high-quality music with minimal setup.
